# Bikeshare

Bikeshare was a project to design a cost prediction model to predict whether or not specific weather patterns affect the amount of 
Bikeshare users in the Bay Area. The Bikeshare dataset comes from Bikeshare, a company which leases bike to the user base on an hourly 
or daily fee. The goal was to predict the cost profit on any given day given the weather pattern.

The main collaborators of the project was Daniel Man, Daniela Barrera Mejia, and Avi Rynderman.

Work was split as followed:

Daniel: Preprocessing, Clustering


Daniela: Random Forest


Avi: Decision Tree
